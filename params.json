{"name":"Blink","tagline":"Blink.js","body":"###What is Blink?\r\nBlink is a basic JavaScript/jQuery application intended to have a little fun with extending the overly-used `<blink>` tags in the late 90's (ah, the days of early web development!).\r\n\r\n###We thought we could raise the bar...\r\nAnd we did! The script randomly hides and displays (\"blinks\") an element on a web page. Adding to the insanity, it _can_ grab *any* tag (it won't append the behavior to `link`, `script`, or `style` tags...although it wouldn't matter if it did, visually speaking). Throw this into a project with a couple-second delay and watch your designers lose their minds!\r\n\r\n###Of course it's customizable\r\nBeyond being open-source, changing the speed at which things blink is a matter of setting a single variable. I'm sure someone can take this even further...","google":"UA-53186538-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
