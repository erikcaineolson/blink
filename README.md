###A little old-school fun with jQuery and JavaScript

Blink makes stuff appear and disappear (at random) on a page. Some friends and I have been joking for a while about this, and I finally decided to put it up.

Blink grabs a tag at random and applies an interval CSS control to make some portion appear and disappear at random.

All you have to do is include the script, stylesheet, and then call Blink(*n*) (where *n* is in milliseconds, so 1000*n* = 1 second).
